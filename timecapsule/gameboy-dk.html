          <p>Donkey Kong, developed by Nintendo EAD, was published in 1994.
            The game was based after its first release in the arcade platform version.
            The difference is that the iconic character, Mario, is switched with the character shown in the arcade version.
            The gameplay consists of the same methodology, maneuvering through platforms to save Pauline from the hands of Donkey Kong.
            Mario must dodge incoming objects thrown by Donkey Kong.
