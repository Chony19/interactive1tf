          <p>Kirby’s Dream Land, released in 1992 by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo, was the spark for the Kirby game series.
            As we all know, Kirby’s iconic copying ability isn’t introduced in this game until Kirby’s adventure.
            The game consists of levels that side-scrolls as the character moves.
            Kirby’s abilities are, jumping, moving, and inhaling objects thrown by enemies to later reflect them as a weapon.
            Kirby can also fly by inflating himself with air.
