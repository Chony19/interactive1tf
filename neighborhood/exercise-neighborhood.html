    <h1>WELCOME TO</h1> <h1>JAPAN TOWN</h1>

    <h2 id="japancenter">JAPAN CENTER</h2>
     <h3>KINOKUNIYA BUILDING</h3>
      <img class="outsidejapancenter" src="assets/outsidejapancenter.jpg"/>
      <img class="outsidejapancenter" src="assets/insidejapancenter.jpg"/>
       <h4>Kinokuniya Building Shops and Restaurants located in Japan Town offers a variety of shops that are inspired by Japanese culture. This includes noodle shops, book shops, stationaries, restaurants, and many others. Kinokuniya is a place for those who would like to spend their day in a Japanese influenced town and to know more about the culture. </h4>

     <h3 id="katsuragarden">KATSURA GARDEN</h3>
      <img class="katsuragarden" src="assets/katsuragardenoutside.jpg"/>
      <img class="katsuragarden" src="assets/katsuragardeninside.jpg"/>
      <h4>At the entrance of Kinokuniya Building Shops and Restaurants, this little shop is known for its bonsai collection, varieties of succulents, and other types of plants.
          Going to this shop as a college student is essential if you want to get a small plant for your dorm. Having a succulent, which is an affordable plant and easy to take care of, improves your living quality now that you are required to take care of a plant that isn’t too delicate to water necessities.</h4>

     <h3 id="kinokuniyabooks">KINOKUNIYA BOOKS</h3>
      <img class="kinokuniyabooks" src="assets/kinokuniyabooksoutside.jpg"/>
      <img class="kinokuniyabooks" src="assets/kinokuniyabooksinside.jpg"/>
       <h4>Inside Kinokuniya Books, you will find a variety of stationaries, books, and magazines that come all the way from Japan. Kinokuniya Books specializes in Manga which is a type of Japanese comic book. Even though these books com all the way from Japan, the store also offers books translated to English and some in Chinese.
           From my experience, I am not a book person, however, I totally recommend going to the shop and acquiring those books that you are willing to buy. A first-hand experience with the book, being able to touch and see how the book feels has a different emotion than buying the book from an online website.</h4>

     <h3 id="izumiyarestaurant">IZUMIYA RESTAURANT</h3>
      <img class="izumiyarest" src="assets/isumiyaoutside.jpg"/>
      <img class="izumiyamenu" src="assets/izumiyamenu.jpg"/>
       <h4>Izumiya Restaurant, located on the second floor of the Kinokuniya Building, is an authentic Japanese restaurant that offers different plates from the Japanese cuisines. The restaurant offers okonomiyaki, a Japanese-style pancake; ramen, sushi, as well as, offering sake.
           I am proud to say that most of my visits to Japan Town, Izumiya is the restaurant that I have mostly visited. Even though it is a little bit pricy, I recommend this restaurant that offers traditional dishes.</h4>

    <h2 id="japanpeacetown">JAPAN PEACE TOWN</h2>
     <h3 id="peacepagoda">PEACE PAGODA</h3>
      <img class="japanpeacetown" src="assets/peacepagoda-japanpeacetown.jpg"/>
      <img class="peacepagodacloseup" src="assets/peacepagodacloseup-japanpeacetown.jpg"/>
      <img class="japanpeacetown" src="assets/peacepagodasunbehind-japanpeacetown.jpg"/>
       <h4>Located in the heart of Japan Town, the Peace Pagoda is a 5-tiered (5-leveled) stupa that was gifted from Osaka to the city of San Francisco to show the peaceful unity between the two countries. Hence, the name Peace Pagoda.
           A gift from Osaka, Japan, that can also be considered as a tourist attraction, the Pagoda serves as an essential place to rest after a long day. Resting in the open area lets you connect with the wind that blows in any direction in the town. Moreover, the lighting system installed in the plaza that lights up after beautiful sunsets serves as another sculpture to take photos of.</h4>

     <h3 id="japanvideo">JAPAN VIDEO</h3>
      <img class="japanvideo" src="assets/japanvideooutside.jpg"/>
      <img class="japanvideo" src="assets/japanvideoinside.jpg"/>
       <h4>Japan video offers a variety of Japanese, Korean, and Chinese video collections. Almost the same as Kinokuniya Books, Japan Video also features merchandise from famous shows. Merchandise such as posters, plushies, 3D action figures, and many others.
           As an individual inspired by Japanese culture, I often find myself visiting this store every time I visit Japan Town. Even though I usually don’t buy anything, I enjoy visiting the store to see what novelties or new products they offer.</h4>

     <h3 id="daisojapan">DAISO JAPAN</h3>
      <img class="daiso" src="assets/daisooutside.jpg"/>
      <img class="daiso" src="assets/daisoinside.jpg"/>
       <h4>Often called the worldwide “Japanese Dollar Store,” Daiso offers products that vary from stationery, home goods, cosmetics, and even selling Japanese snacks. Even though their prices are low, the quality and presentation of the products are delightful.
           As a college student, Daiso Japan is one of the stationary places that one must go to get the supplies that most of our professors will ask for. As well as getting utilities for our dorm life. The cheap prices that Daiso features are fundamental for those who are living on a budget.</h4>
