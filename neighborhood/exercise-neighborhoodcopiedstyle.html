    <h4>"Going to this shop as a college student is essential if you want to get a small plant for your dorm.
          Having a succulent, which is an affordable plant and easy to take care of, improves your living
          quality now that you are required to take care of a plant that isn’t too delicate to water
          necessities." - Tony's opinion.
          </h4>

    <h4>"From my experience, I am not a book person, however, I totally recommend going to the shop and
          acquiring those books that you are willing to buy. A first-hand experience with the book, being
          able to touch and see how the book feels has a different emotion than buying the book from an
          online website." - Tony's opinion.
